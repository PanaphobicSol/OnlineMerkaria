Each of the twelve moons of [[Merkaria]] have a physical manifestation that appears on the planet once every three years during its [[Eclipse|eclipse]]. These incarnations represent the domains of all gods associated with that moon, in both appearance and behavior. Very little is known about them as their existences are often considered unimaginable, in scale or even concept.
