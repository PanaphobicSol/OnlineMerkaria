You will recognize the Merkadian Calendar as being nearly identical to our own: 365 days split between [[The Pantheon and its Seasons|four seasons]] and further into twelve months. Additionally, every month has exactly thirty days and the New Year is recognized as taking place on March 1st. This is due to the fact that there is a fifth, [[Godless|pseudo-season]] lasting five days after December 30th, and six days every four years instead.
