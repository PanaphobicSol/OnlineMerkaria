Below are the holidays of [[Merkaria]] and their associated gods, seasons, or sects as well as an overview of their purposes.


### New Year's Day - March 1st
Celebrated as the beginning of an year on Merkaria. Often the busiest time of year and everyone balances celebration with resuming their work.

### Spring Equinox - March 1st
The first day of the year when the sun of Renewal is first seen and both day and night are in balance.

### Fools' Fortune - April 1st
The day of the year in which gods of trickery, chaos, and all forms of pranks or japes encourage citizens to be more light hearted and unwind after the stress of beginning a new year. Pranks however often get out of hand and have unintended consequences which may result in financial, social, or ecological set backs. Especially if any higher beings decide to get involved. Gods help you if April's Incarnation appears this year.
