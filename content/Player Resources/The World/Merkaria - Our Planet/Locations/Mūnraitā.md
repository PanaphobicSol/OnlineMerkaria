The village of [[M큰nrait훮]] is also unofficially aligned with Assembly, as they have lived in such exclusion that the world is largely unaware of them. M큰nrait훮 sits deep in the oceanic trenches, built along and within a mid-ocean ridge which runs parallel to a deep gash in the seafloor. This geological formation is known as Kuyutha's Fault. Light from the surface barely reaches the peak of the ridge, but the town survives the cold by harnessing the warmth of the hydrothermal vents.
