The town of Cladonia is situated between the capitol and main port of [[Las Tovas]]. It is the first [[Mycelian]] colony discovered after the land was settled by its founders centuries ago.  While the town is primarily inhabited by Mycelian's, many other citizens of Las Tovas settled alongside them, embracing their lifecycle and wishing to be a part of it. The town looks as if it has been overgrown by fungi, when in reality it is the aesthetic and functional choice to promote cohabitation.
