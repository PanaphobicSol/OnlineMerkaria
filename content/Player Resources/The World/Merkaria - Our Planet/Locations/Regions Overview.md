A Theocracy located in the center of the northernmost continent. It's founders arrived to the area by boat, quickly settling along the river while working their way inland towards the mountains where they would later build their capital. Along the way, they discovered a dormant [[Mycelian]] colony in the tundra when their dead began reanimating. 
The country is run by a council of "elected" religious officials, chosen every two years by the gods of their sect from the five most prosperous cities that period. Of course, "prosperity" in this case being the areas with the greatest number of devotees to the sect. Due to their sheer number, Mycelians are given a position on the council every period as acknowledgement from the gods, despite most of their devotion being directed towards the "Mothershroom" and not the pantheon itself. Additionally, every terms the council elects one of the previous terms members to be the Chancellor to oversee meetings, settle disputes, and act as a public face.
Kai's character is from the town of Cladonia in this country.
