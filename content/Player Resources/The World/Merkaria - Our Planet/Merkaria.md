The planet of Merkaria delicately weaves in orbit around the Prime Material Plane's [[Celestial Bodies|four suns]]. If not for the grace of the gods, disaster surely would have befallen this world and its denizens. Instead, it has flourished and developed over the millennia into a planet filled with new technologies, arcane understandings, agricultural techniques, cultural exchange, and economic growth. 
This past century, however, has been marked by near constant conflict. From grand wars between kingdoms, to increased hostility among guilds, from economic collapse to religious disputes, Merkaria has been plagued by infighting and disasters.






## Topography
Merkaria's land is split between twelve countries.

## Regions Overview

Each sect of Merkaria's pantheon is also the primary influence for one of the world's twelve main political powers, outlined below. For more details on the sects themselves, see [[Seasons, Sects, and Suns]].

#### March -  Resolution (L)

#### April - Blooming (C)
TBD
#### May - Sowing (N)
TBD
#### June -  Arrangement (N)
TBD
#### July - Reverence (L)
TBD
#### August - Commendation (C)
TBD
#### September -  Assembly (L)
A Theocracy whose land is split across the entirety of Merkaria's surface. Rather than amass all of their resources in a single location, they have settled across the vast sea to ensure their "home" is always a only a short trip away.
Originating in the North-Western Hemisphere, the inhabitants of Assembly have spread out through the years into a series of settlements, caravans, flotillas, and camp grounds all over the world, many of which exist outside the bounds of their legal borders but are Assembly in spirit. Of course, the land which is theirs officially has sprawling cities created as the bastions of their people, welcoming home any of their citizens regardless of origin. 
Each of the main segments of Assembly is organized and ran by the largest church in the area, supported by the smaller churches around it.
#### October - Reaping (C)
TBD
#### November - Remembrance (N)
TBD
#### December -  Sharp Winds (C)
TBD
#### January - Last Rights (L)
A Theocracy located in the center of the northernmost continent. It's founders arrived to the area by boat, quickly settling along the river while working their way inland towards the mountains where they would later build their capital. Along the way, they discovered a dormant [[Mycelian]] colony in the tundra when their dead began reanimating. 
The country is run by a council of "elected" religious officials, chosen every two years by the gods of their sect from the five most prosperous cities that period. Of course, "prosperity" in this case being the areas with the greatest number of devotees to the sect. Due to their sheer number, Mycelians are given a position on the council every period as acknowledgement from the gods, despite most of their devotion being directed towards the "Mothershroom" and not the pantheon itself. Additionally, every terms the council elects one of the previous terms members to be the Chancellor to oversee meetings, settle disputes, and act as a public face.
Kai's character is from the town of Cladonia in this country.
#### February - Cleansing (N)
