The planet of Merkaria delicately weaves in orbit around the Prime Material Plane's [[Celestial Bodies|four suns]]. If not for the grace of the gods, disaster surely would have befallen this world and its denizens. Instead, it has flourished and developed over the millennia into a planet filled with new technologies, arcane understandings, agricultural techniques, cultural exchange, and economic growth. 
This past century, however, has been marked by near constant conflict. From grand wars between kingdoms, to increased hostility among guilds, from economic collapse to religious disputes, Merkaria has been plagued by infighting and disasters.






### Topography
Merkaria's land is split between twelve countries, outlined in [[Regions Overview]].
