The planet of Merkaria delicately weaves in orbit around the Prime Material Plane's [[Celestial Bodies|four suns]]. If not for the grace of the gods, disaster surely would have befallen this world and its denizens. Instead, it has flourished and developed over the millennia into a planet filled with new technologies, arcane understandings, agricultural techniques, cultural exchange, and economic growth. 
This past century, however, has been marked by near constant conflict. From grand wars between kingdoms, to increased hostility among guilds, from economic collapse to religious disputes, Merkaria has been plagued by infighting and disasters.






## Topography
Merkaria's land is split between twelve countries.

The capital city changes based on trade and need, but the name "Parabellum" is awarded to the whichever is the current capital.
#### April - Blooming (C)
The primary nation aligned with Blooming are [[The Caperic Baronies]]. Viceroyalty. The country Grandma Stinky was raised in. Her coven and the surrounding region was full of toxic pleasantries and condescension towards anything else. Their concern with appearances resulted in a lack of expansion and many losses.

#### August - Commendation (C)

#### September -  Assembly (L)
The primary nation aligned with Assembly is known as [[Cidmair]]. Community. Is is a Theocracy whose land is split across the entirety of Merkaria's surface. Rather than amass all of their resources in a single location, they have settled across the vast sea to ensure their "home" is always a only a short trip away.
Originating in the North-Western Hemisphere, the inhabitants of Cidmair have spread out through the years into a series of settlements, caravans, flotillas, and camp grounds all over the world, many of which exist outside the bounds of their legal borders but are Cidmair in function and in spirit. Of course, the land which is theirs officially has sprawling cities created as the bastions of their people, welcoming home any of their citizens regardless of origin. 
Each of the main segments of Cidmair is organized and ran by the largest church in the area, supported by the smaller churches around it.

The village of [[M큰nrait훮]] is also unofficially aligned with Assembly, as they have lived in such exclusion that the world is largely unaware of them. M큰nrait훮 sits deep in the oceanic trenches, built along and within a mid-ocean ridge which runs parallel to a deep gash in the seafloor. This geological formation is known as Kuyutha's Fault. Light from the surface barely reaches the peak of the ridge, but the town survives the cold by harnessing the warmth of the hydrothermal vents. 

#### October - Reaping (C)
The primary nation aligned with Reaping is known as [[Gias Dim]]. Shogunate.
#### November - Remembrance (N)
The primary nation aligned with Remembrance is known as [[Psydis Elyon]]. Tetrarchate.
#### December -  Sharp Winds (C)
The primary nation aligned with Sharp Winds is known as [[Whainsfrost]]. Exarchate. Multiple Exarchs of this sect govern the individual territories. Very protective of their secrets and privacy.
#### January - Last Rights (L)
The primary nation aligned with Last Rights is known as [[Las Tovas]]. A Theocracy located in the center of the northernmost continent. The controlling body of Las Tovas is a council of appointed religious officials, chosen every two years by the Last Rights pantheon based on the five most prosperous cities and their primarily worshiped deity. Due to their sheer number, Mycelians are given a position on the council every period as acknowledgement from the gods, despite most of their devotion being directed towards the "Mothershroom" and not the pantheon itself. Additionally, the council elects one of the previous term's members to be the Chancellor. The Chancellor is the sixth seat, responsible for overseeing meetings, settling disputes, and acting as a public face.
Kai's character is from the town of [[Cladonia]] in this country.
#### February - Cleansing (N)
The primary nation aligned with Cleansing is known as [[Detmobia]] and is under the control of House Phascera. Oligarchy.
