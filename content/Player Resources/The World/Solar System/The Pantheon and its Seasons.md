Each sun of Merkaria represents an aspect of its Gods of Merkaria, operating in tandem with the change in seasons. The seasons, each lasting 90 days precisely, are Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. The suns associated with each season are Renewal, Plenty, Decline, and Slumber, respectively. Each sun contains within its orbit three moons, named after the three primary gods that preside over its season.
The end of a year is marked by a five day period of night between Slumber/Winter and Renewal/Spring. This period is marked by it being largely disconnected from the gods and their seasons, lacking in joy, comfort, and daylight for the duration. This "godless season" is referred to by names such as: The Bleak, The Eerie, and The Yugoloths' Hunt. Every four years, this "season" lasts for six days instead of five, believed to be a way for the gods to challenge mortals and remind them how even one extra day without them can be horrific.
