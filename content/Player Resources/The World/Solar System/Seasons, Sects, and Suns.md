Each sun of Merkaria represents an aspect of its Gods of Merkaria, operating in tandem with the change in seasons. The seasons each last 90 days
and are Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. The suns associated with each season are Renewal, Plenty, Decline, and Slumber, respectively. In fact, some cultures use the names of the suns and seasons interchangeably. 
Each sun contains within its orbit three moons, named after the section, or sect, of the pantheon that has greatest influence over the month in which that moon is closest to [[Merkaria]]. Each of the [[Regions Overview|twelve countries]] that have divided up Merkaria corresponds to one of these sects as well, indicating, to some degree, their general belief systems and cultures as well as the month in which they are most powerful.
Additionally, the end of a year is marked by a five day period of night between Slumber/Winter and Renewal/Spring. This period is noted for being largely disconnected from both the gods and their seasons, a time lacking in joy, comfort, and daylight for the duration. This "godless season" is referred to by names such as: The Bleak, The Eerie, and The Yugoloths' Hunt. Every four years, this "season" lasts for six days instead of five, believed to be a way for the gods to challenge mortals and remind them that even one extra day without them can be horrific.

## Godless Solstice
Depending on who you ask, the people of Merkaria have many explanations for this season. Some say it's a test of perseverance sent by the gods. Some say it's a bitter reminder of how much mortals rely on the divine. Some say it's a time in which the forces operating in foil to Pantheon are at their most powerful, exerting their influence over the [Prime Material Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_Material_plane). Some say that Merkaria's orbit puts them at the center of the solar system, just out of reach of the suns and their gods' light. Whatever it may be, there is no consensus. 
One archaic name, yet still quite prevalent in superstitious literature, refers to this season as "The Yugoloths' Hunt".  The [[Yugoloth|Yugoloths]] in question being a particular type of Fiend known for their manipulations, deals, and history of mercenary-like behavior. The belief being that the darkness gives these beings a greater influence on our plane, resulting in denizens of our plane being especially susceptible to their contracts and machinations.
