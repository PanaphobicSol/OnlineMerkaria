A year on [[Merkaria]] is denoted by the planet's orbit around and between the four suns of the [Prime Material Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_Material_plane), each representing an aspect of its pantheon. 

Upon entering a sun's orbit, the three moons of that season will align themselves with Merkaria and begin their lunar cycle. Once complete, the moons will exit Merkaria's orbit and remain within its sun's until the next year as Merkaria continues on to the next season.
