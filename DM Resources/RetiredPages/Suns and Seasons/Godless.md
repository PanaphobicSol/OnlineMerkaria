Depending on who you ask, the people of Merkaria have many explanations for this season. Some say it's a test of perseverance sent by the gods. Some say it's a bitter reminder of how much mortals rely on the divine. Some say it's a time in which the forces operating in foil to Pantheon are at their most powerful, exerting their influence over the [Prime Material Plane](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Prime_Material_plane). Some say that Merkaria's orbit puts them at the center of the solar system, just out of reach of the suns and their gods' light. Whatever it may be, there is no consensus. 
One archaic name, yet still quite prevalent in superstitious literature, refers to this season as "The Yugoloths' Hunt".  The [[Yugoloth|Yugoloths]] in question being a particular type of Fiend known for their manipulations, deals, and history of mercenary-like behavior. The belief being that the darkness gives these beings a greater influence on our plane, resulting in denizens of our plane being especially susceptible to their contracts and machinations.
