The planet of Merkaria delicately weaves in orbit around the Prime Material Plane's [[Celestial Bodies|four suns]]. If not for the grace of the gods, disaster surely would have befallen this world and its denizens. Instead, it has flourished and developed over the millennia into a planet filled with new technologies, arcane understandings, agricultural techniques, cultural exchange, and economic growth. 
This past century, however, has been marked by near constant conflict. From grand wars between kingdoms, to increased hostility among guilds, from economic collapse to religious disputes, Merkaria has been plagued by infighting and disasters.






## Topography
Merkaria's land is split between twelve countries.

#### September -  Assembly (L)
The primary nation aligned with Assembly is known as (Civ VI, Sid Meier) Cidmair. Is is a Theocracy whose land is split across the entirety of Merkaria's surface. Rather than amass all of their resources in a single location, they have settled across the vast sea to ensure their "home" is always a only a short trip away.
Originating in the North-Western Hemisphere, the inhabitants of Cidmair have spread out through the years into a series of settlements, caravans, flotillas, and camp grounds all over the world, many of which exist outside the bounds of their legal borders but are Cidmair in function and in spirit. Of course, the land which is theirs officially has sprawling cities created as the bastions of their people, welcoming home any of their citizens regardless of origin. 
Each of the main segments of Cidmair is organized and ran by the largest church in the area, supported by the smaller churches around it.

The village of M큰nrait훮 is also unofficially aligned with Assembly, as they have lived in such exclusion that the world is largely unaware of them. M큰nrait훮 sits deep in the oceanic trenches, built along and within a mid-ocean ridge which runs parallel to a deep gash in the seafloor. This geological formation is known as Kuyutha's Fault. Light from the surface barely reaches the peak of the ridge, but the town survives the cold by harnessing the warmth of the hydrothermal vents.

Along the way, they discovered a dormant [[Mycelian]] colony in the tundra when their dead began reanimating. 
The country is run by a council of "elected" religious officials, chosen every two years by the gods of their sect from the five most prosperous cities that period. Of course, "prosperity" in this case being the areas with the greatest number of devotees to the sect. Due to their sheer number, Mycelians are given a position on the council every period as acknowledgement from the gods, despite most of their devotion being directed towards the "Mothershroom" and not the pantheon itself. Additionally, every terms the council elects one of the previous terms members to be the Chancellor to oversee meetings, settle disputes, and act as a public face.
